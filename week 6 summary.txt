data visualization is an important tool in analyzing the dataset. correct visualizations provide accurate information. if visualizations are done incorrectly it will confuse the people and conveys wrong information. in 2007, Purdue pharma made wrong visualizations and paid a fine up to $600million, so one needs to be careful while providing visualizations. it is very easy to tell a story about a dataset with the help of graphics. Nowadays all conference poster,journal articles are using figures to describe their story. To get the best visualizations there are 5 sets of principles, they are 1. Focus on the message:-Figures should convey the correct message by choosing desired plot type, such as histograms, bar, pie, line, etc. 2. Displays must be fit-for-purpose:-it is important to think about why and for whom we are visualizing the data. 3.simplify:-use simple plots which are appropriate to convey the information.it is also called maximizing the data-to-ink ratio which means the main focus should be on the data.4.every graph should stand on its own:-always include a title for the graph and label every axis, if there are multiple groups in a graph then include a symbol key. 5.avoid deception:-label axis with appropriate scale.These 5 principles will help to create informative data analysis.
