 What hardware did miners start with? What did they move to? How quickly were these changes? â€‹

ince 2009, bitcoin has experienced exponential growth. Bitcoin's success is a series of logical innovations, from software to hardware implementations. Miners used six different pieces of hardware for the development of bitcoin. They started with CPUs: first-generation miners, which have very simple source code. However, multicore machines have extra hardware, which results in wasted performance and efficiency. So they moved to GPUs, second-generation miners. These proved much more useful than FPGAs. They used five GPUs to improve the efficiency. It resulted in challenges like power and cooling requirements of multiple GPUs, which require large air volume for cooling. So in 2011, miners moved to FPGAs (third-generation miners). They are good at processing. They are five times more efficient than GPUs. However, they had trouble competing on cost. As a result, miners shifted to The ASIC RACE, in which fourth-generation bitcoin miners from three companies named Butterfly Labs, ASIC Miner, and Avalon entered the market. ASIC WAR: the fifth generation of bitcoin miners has better architecture and more advanced process nodes, but it has limited usefulness. As a result, miners shifted to ASIC VICTORS: sixth generation miners, which became more popular in the industry for three reasons: enclosing machine and data center can be codesigned; time to run ASIC is reduced; and tuning ASIC chip promised efficiency and performance.
